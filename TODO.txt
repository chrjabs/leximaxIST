- put options: specify external solver, if solving with pbo or maxsat, leave temporary files or not.

- print_solution. Should I print the optimum of each iteration (the i-th maximum)?

Improvements: Incremental MaxSAT? Encoding of comparators - should we put the equivalence? Or implication suffices? Dealing with time restrictions - approximation tecniques? In each iteration we have guarantee of minimising the first maxima.

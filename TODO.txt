- How to test if this tool is printing leximax-optimal solutions? For small inputs -  use pienum to enumerate models of input problem and compute all objective vectors and then check which solutions minimise the objective vectors with respect to the leximax order. -> write the part of receiving input from pienum and check the Leximax-optimal solutions - brute force.

- put options: specify external solver, if solving with pbo or maxsat, leave temporary files or not.

- print_solution. Should I print the optimum of each iteration (the i-th maximum)?

Improvements: Incremental MaxSAT? Encoding of comparators - should we put the equivalence? Or implication suffices? Dealing with time restrictions - approximation tecniques? In each iteration we have guarantee of minimising the first maxima.

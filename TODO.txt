Next step: use the tool with packup. How? system call? Library (-how?)?
Doing the library:
Do the destructor to free memory - check code for memory leaks - DONE
Do the constructor to use as a library, without reading from file - DONE
Check code for vector.clear() <- might make sense to use shrink_to_fit to free space - DONE, no need for this

Test with CUDF examples.
Collect results.
Finish thesis.

Improvements: Incremental MaxSAT? Encoding of comparators - should we put the equivalence? Or implication suffices? Dealing with time restrictions - approximation tecniques? In each iteration we have guarantee of minimising the first maxima.

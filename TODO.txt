Next step: use the tool with packup. How? system call? Library (-how?)?
Test with CUDF examples.
Collect results.
Finish thesis.

Improvements: Incremental MaxSAT? Encoding of comparators - should we put the equivalence? Or implication suffices? Dealing with time restrictions - approximation tecniques? In each iteration we have guarantee of minimising the first maxima.
